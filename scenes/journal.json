My memory is fragmented - I can't recall how we got here or what happened to them. My head pounds with each heartbeat, and my body feels weak, as if I've been unconscious for days.</p><p class=\"journal-paragraph\">Whatever happened here, I appear to be the sole survivor. The last thing I remember is a blinding flash of light, and then... nothing. I need to piece together what happened and find a way out of these woods.</p>",

The air is chill and damp, carrying the scent of decay and wood.</p><p class=\"journal-paragraph\">These woods seem largely untouched by civilization, wild and primeval. Local legends say these woods are home to ancient spirits and creatures not seen elsewhere. The dense foliage makes it easy to get lost, and the constant shadows create an atmosphere of watchful silence.</p>",
